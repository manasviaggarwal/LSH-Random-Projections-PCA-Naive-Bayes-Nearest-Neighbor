# TIPR

tipr-first-assignment

This is the first assignment of TIPR-2019. The problems in this assignment revolve around the concepts like Locality sensitive hashing(LSH), Random Projections and PCA. These are techniques for converting higher-dimensional data to lower-dimension without losing significant information.

It also encompasses two very important classifiers - Naive Bayes and Nearest Neighbour.
